#Examining WT Decay in SRD-Target PSU Genes vs Non-SRD_Target PSU Genes
#GO Term analysis is included, looks at the WTdecay rates between the PSUs/HSUs and compares them. 

#load in the data/set up the workspace: 
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(matrixStats)

allusfilt <- fread('allusfilt.csv', header = TRUE) 
SRDPSU <- fread('SRD_PSU.csv', header = TRUE)
PSUs <- fread('PSUs.csv', header = TRUE)
JoesPSU <- fread('JoesPSU.csv', header = TRUE)
HSUs <- fread('HSUs.csv', header = TRUE)

#Compare the decay rate involves the WT difference means 
#Make the dataframe with the Non-SRD involved PSUs: 
nonsrd <- filter(PSUs, PSUs$`WT/KO` < 1.2) #2678 nonSRD
srd <- filter(PSUs, PSUs$`WT/KO` > 1.2) #355 SRD 

#We will be looking at the WTdiffmeans and comparing them to see whether one decays faster: 
summary(nonsrd$WTdiffmeans)
#For Non-SRD PSUs, the median decay rate is 2.0074 and mean is 2.8514 (min: 0.2143, max: 79.75)

summary(srd$WTdiffmeans)
#For SRD PSUs, the median decay rate is 4.220, mean is 5.913 (min:1.260, max:45.071)
#Just based on summary statistics, the SRD PSUs have a hugely different WT decay rate
 
#Graphing for Visualization: 
ggplot(PSUs, aes(x = log(WTdiffmeans), y =log(`WT/KO`))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_classic()

t.test(log(srd$WTdiffmeans), log(nonsrd$WTdiffmeans))
#the srd WT decay rate is significantly different for PSUs vs non-PSUs (p value < 2.2E-16)

summary(lm(formula = PSUs$`WT/KO` ~ PSUs$WTdiffmeans, data = PSUs))
#Coefficients: (Intercept = 0.945) (Slope = 0.01984)
#Slope (p <2e-16, so the slope is significantly different)

#####Looking at WT decay in HSUs: 
hsunonsrd <- filter(HSUs, HSUs$`WT/KO` < 1.2)
hsusrd <- filter(HSUs, HSUs$`WT/KO` > 1.2)

summary(hsunonsrd$WTdiffmeans)
#Median = 1.98, Mean = 2.814

summary(hsusrd$WTdiffmeans)
#Median = 3.65, mean = 5.29

ggplot(HSUs, aes(x = log(WTdiffmeans), y =log(`WT/KO`))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_classic()

t.test(log(hsusrd$WTdiffmeans), log(hsunonsrd$WTdiffmeans))
#p-value < 2.2E-16, so yes, SRD HSUs are also very different decay rates in WT 

summary(lm(formula = HSUs$`WT/KO` ~ HSUs$WTdiffmeans, data = HSUs))
#lm shows that p is also less than 2E-16, showing that HSUs are also the same kinda different
#HSU slope is 0.03125, intercept is 0.96

#Write up: What we find in the GO terms: 
#GO terms say that there is a lot of regulation of cellular response
#cell population proliferation, G Protein signaling, biological regulation (regulation of ossification)
#Pattern Specification Process
#Negative Regulation of Gene Expression 

#Regulation: Regulation of cellular responses, cell population profileration, G Protein signaining, 
#Pattern Specification Process: Developmental process than results in the creation of defined areas/space
#Negative Regulation of Gene Expression
