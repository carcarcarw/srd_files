Hello! Thank you for checking out my README file for my Structure-Mediated RNA Decay project characterizing Poorly Structured 3' UTRs. 

In the files in this folder, I have written the goals of each file within the title (and have commented out what each step of code is trying to acheive). Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions at my email: cwang141@jhu.edu
